\description{
  Microbial community data consist of abundances of 985 bacteria species measured at 56 soil sample sites from three regions, Kilpisjarvi (Finland), Ny-Alesund (Norway), and Mayrhofen (Austria). In addition to bacteria counts, three continuous environmental variables (pH, available phosphorous and soil organic matter) were measured from each soil sample.

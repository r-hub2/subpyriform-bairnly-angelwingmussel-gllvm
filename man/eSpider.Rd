\details{
Counts of hunting spiders in a dune area in the Netherlands, measured with 100 different pitfall traps. This dataset was published with permission from the CANOCO FORTRAN package (version 4 or higher) example datasets.

Species names have been abbreviated, corresponding to: 
Alopacce = \emph{Alopecosa accentuata}, Alopcune = \emph{Alopecosa cuneata}, Alopfabr = \emph{Alopecosa fabrilis}, Arctlute = \emph{Arctosa lutetiana}, Arctperi = \emph{Arctosa perita}, Auloalbi = \emph{Aulonia albimana}, Pardlugu = \emph{Pardosa lugubris}, Pardmont = \emph{Pardosa monticola}, Pardnigr = \emph{Pardosa nigriceps}, Pardpull = \emph{Pardosa pullata}, Trocterr = \emph{Trochosa terricola}, Zoraspin = \emph{Zora spinimana}.

Environmental measurements were taken at 28 of the 100 pitfall traps measuring soil properties(Water content: "conWate", Humus content: "conHumu", Acidity (pH-KCl)), vegetation ("BareSand": percentage bare sand, "FallTwig": cover on the ground by leaves and twigs, "CovMoss": cover by mosses and lichens, "CovHerb": cover by the herb and grass layer (including maximum height, minimum height, "CovCala": cover by \emph{Calamagrostis epigejos}, cover by \emph{Carex arenaria}, "CovFest": cover by \emph{Festuca ovina}, "CovCory": cover by \emph{Corynephorus canescens}, "CovUrti": cover by \emph{Urtica dioica}, "CovMoeh": cover by \emph{Moehringia trinervia}), "CovShru": cover by the shrub layer (minimum and maximum height, and "CovLigu": cover by \emph{Ligustrum vulgare}), "CovTree": cover by the tree layer (including maximum height, cover by \emph{Populus tremula} or \emph{Crataegus monogyna})), and light properties ("LuxGrey": lux at equal grey sky, "LuxSun": lux at cloudless sky, "LuxRef": lux by reflection of the soil surface)

The original publication of Canonical Correspondence Analysis used standardized versions of the \code{log} and \code{log1p} transformed predictors "ConWate", "BareSand", "FallTwig",  "CovMoss", "CovHerb", "LuxRef".
